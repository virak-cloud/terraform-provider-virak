    "Configure the provider with a valid API token before using resources or data sources. Set via configuration or VIRAKCLOUD_TOKEN environment variable.",
    "Ensure proper resource dependencies for networks and volumes before attaching to instances. Use explicit depends_on or reference attributes.",
    "Always specify a valid zone_id when creating resources, as all resources must be created in a specific zone. Use the virakcloud_zones data source to list available zones.",
    "Use the correct network type (L2 or Isolated) based on your requirements. Isolated networks support custom gateways and netmasks, while L2 networks provide basic layer 2 connectivity.",
    "Use descriptive and unique names for resources to avoid conflicts. Network names must be unique within a zone, and resource names should follow your organization's naming conventions.",
    "Store Terraform state files securely and consider using remote state storage for team collaboration. Avoid committing .tfstate files to version control."
